<h1>Blog Post #2</h1>
<h3>The public view vs the developer</h3>
<p>=======================</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the 70’s we had complex systems that involved calling your computer, inserting your whole program before running your machine, and giant computer rooms, and now we have machines that can sit in your lap while you sit in your living room with your feet propped up. It seems like the two couldn’t be more different when in fact they have the same fundamentals as their now <em>ancient</em> predecessors. </p>
<p>In the beginning there was Macs vs Windows. Macs with their flashy user interface, choosing to display a silly little face when users crashed their laptops and their shiny outer casing they were the users preference. Where as Windows had a stronger computer that ran so well many people were concerned it would end up a doomsday device, the overall aesthetics weren’t user oriented and thus didn’t capture the consumers heart. That bias still lingers today, with Macs being preferred for their sleek design and easy to use interface, and windows being second choice and used by select audiences who prefer windows flexibility for customization. </p>
<p>The point being, in the matters of the computer, design and user experience should be held equally to function. Making sure the average user of whatever you are designing or creating can easily understand and use it is super important.</p>
<p>Beyond the surface level of this is of course the guts of your project. Having a system that most efficiently runs what you need to run is important. Beautiful UX means nothing if the system behind it is slow, or ineffective. Especially in today’s tech world it is important to make sure you are creating systems that run smoothly and as quickly as possible to keep up with the speed in which users are used to. </p>
<p>Deciding to use a monolith or a micro service set up can be crucial to how your system runs. Small systems can be condensed into a monolith system for a smooth run. Keeping everything close and together means everything is codependent on each other, which is why it works for smaller systems. For bigger systems with different components that serve specific functions benefit from a microservice where individual parts can be looked at on a personal level vs as a whole unit. </p>
<p>If we come back to the Mac vs Windows debate we can see the microservice vs monolith system in a physical setting. Macs were/are the preferred laptop choice for many individuals (I personally have been a Windows user since my first laptop but I digress), but they were a pain to fix. Because it was all one group, the computer itself and the interface, when something went wrong they often had to rebuild a whole motherboard. Windows computers were a little easier to fix because they sacrificed on aesthetics and had more of a microservice model. </p>
<h3>Overall Takeaway:</h3>
<p>If I can ask one thing you take away from this post it would be to make sure you examine all aspects of web development. In the past when Front End and Full Stack had more divergence between them it was easy for either side to decide what was more important, design or function, but as the gap between the two closes, developers need to make sure they are not focusing too hard on either side. In a New Age of web development function and beauty need to be hand in hand if you want a successful project.</p>
