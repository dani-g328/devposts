<h1>The Widening Responsibility for Front End Developers.</h1>
<p></p>
<h3>Danielle Gordon</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the world of web development there is two paths taken traditionally. There are the Front End Developers. They focus on browsers. Creating the webpage, making sure it is compatible with all or most browsers (ie, firefox, chrome, internet explorer). They create what the user sees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand is the Back end developers. They work on the things users do not see. Hosting and servers are the main things they work on. Making sure the website can store data and function as the client wants.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>However</em>, in this article written by Chris Covier and published Oct 7th, 2020, he writes about how this form is changing. Chris says in this article that essentially the role of Front End Developers is growing as far as responsibility.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Front-end development is at the intersection of art and logic. A cross of business and expression. Both left and right brain. A cocktail of design and nerdery. </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h6>New Responsibilities of Front-End Developers</h6>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Nova or similar programs to do server side work</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to create entire websites in Javascript</p></li>
<li><p>Be in a sense, the architect of entire websites</p></li>
<li><p>Compartmentalize websites into components </p></li>
<li><p>Use Javascript to track states of a website</p></li>
<li><p>Account for growing capabilities in browsers </p></li>
<li><p>Keeping up with trends and expectations from internet users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>Summery</strong> </h5>
<p></p>
<p>As the world of web development grows so does the <em>individual responsibility</em> of front-end developers. The job market for this work is no longer only about Design and HTML skills, it requires knowledge of servers and Javascript to build more full and complex websites. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Javascript is also growing in capacity. It can do everything HTML or Css can while adding interactive elements that would require several programming languages previously. Using Javascript devs can easily compartmentalize components and manage them easier than using HTML or Css alone.</p>
